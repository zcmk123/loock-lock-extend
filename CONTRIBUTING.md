## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `loock_lock_extend` for local development.

1. Fork the `loock_lock_extend` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/loock_lock_extend.git
   ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

   ```sh
   mkvirtualenv loock_lock_extend
   cd loock_lock_extend/
   python setup.py develop
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

   ```sh
   make lint
   make test
   # Or
   make test-all
   ```

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.12 and 3.13. Tests run in GitHub Actions on every pull request to the main branch, make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```sh
pytest tests.test_loock_lock_extend
```

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.md). Then run:

```sh
bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
git push
git push --tags
```

You can set up a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-python#publishing-to-pypi) to automatically deploy your package to PyPI when you push a new tag.
